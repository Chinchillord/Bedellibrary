Queries
============

[gimmick: math]()
[gimmick:theme](flatly)

Note: This should probably also be something that is automatically generated by the webserver,
and where I keep all of the queries in my database, but for now, here is a list of some of the
specific queries that I would like to eventually implement in my software:

* "Mycroft, what was the quote that I liked about paraconsistent logic that I read a few
 months ago?"
* "Mycroft, list me some of the papers related to categorical quantum mechanics that I have 
   in my library of pdfs."
* "Mycroft, copy the bibtex reference of this paper."
* "Mycroft, display some of the relationships between homotopy type theory and logic that I've 
   found in my personal library."
