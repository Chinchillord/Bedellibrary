[gimmick: math]()
[gimmick:theme](flatly)

Welcome to my markdown wiki! I'd like to eventually provide LaTeX support, but for now,
there should be some basic link functionality at the very least. Hopefully something
that will work well with my semantic wiki concept.

Here is some math!

$$ \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^i $$

Here is some code with syntax highlighting!

```
main :: IO ()
main = do
  print "I love MDwiki!"
```

Supplying a langauge to do the syntax highligting doesn't seem to work very well at the moment

```
print("Hello world")
```

### Subsubsubheeading 2.1.1

Note: This system of subsubheadings, subsubsubheadings, etc... isn't supported by the sidebar navigation, but I could still use depedning on how I want to format the wiki
