Haskell Libraries and Tools I Like 
===================================



Haskell Libraries I like
------------------------

* [pyfi](https://github.com/Russell91/pyfi) This library provides a very nice
  interface from Haskell to Python by letting you write Python code directly
  in Haskell by means of template Haskell. My idea behind this library is that although I like the way in which Haskell allows you to structure your programs, Python makes it easier to preform IO operations, and sometimes allows access to better libraries.

* [hol]("http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hol") This library provides an implementation of higher order logic in Haskell. It is related to my project of natural language processing in Haskell, since the semantics aspect of montague semantics is expressible in formal logic. Also, this is related to my project of natural language understanding, and wanting to build an automated theorem prover in Haskell to help be better understand logic programming.
