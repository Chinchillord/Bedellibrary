Langugages
=========

Note: Here I think I'll just keep some high-level comments on my thoughts about the languages. And links to resources for the langauges that I don't use as frequently. Here I can link to more specailized pages with things like code snippets and libraries that I like, etc...

Note: Also, programming language snippets should probably be something that is automatically generated
by my webserver.
