Hello! Welcome to my personal wiki (Bedellwiki). This is an ongoing project of mine both as a practical tool for organizing my personal notes on a variety of topics that are interesting to me, and as an integral component in an experiment (Bedelllibrary) in natural language understanding, with the end goal being:

  1. To provide a decent and readable user interface for all of the notes that I have made
     pertaining to a number of different projects -- this wiki being one part of this interface.
  2. To provide a store of data that can be used for machine learning, with the eventual goal     being to create a digital personal research assistant that I can make various [queries](queries.md) to regarding different research topics, faciliated by the various semantic tags on this wiki.

Perhaps later I will implement a more complete index, but for now, some relevant pages are:

  * [Haskell libraries and tools I like](haskell_libraries_i_like.md):
  * [Python libraries and tools I like](python_libraries_i_like.md):
  * [Programming languages](programming_languages.md): More general notes on programming languages.
  * [Linguistics](linguistics.md):
     * [Montague Semantics](montague_semantics.md):
  * [Mathematics](mathematics.md):
     * [Category Theory](category_theory.md):
     * [Algebra](algebra.md):
     * [Logic](logic.md):
  * [Things I like](things_i_like.md): This is a page that has been compiled from a LaTeX source file that I used to keep, inspired by a friend of mine who kept a similar "book of favorites". Eventually, I want to be able to automatically compile a similar latex source file from this page of the wiki -- such as to allow for better semantic integration of this source file into my project.
  * [Sandbox](sandbox.md): A markdown page where I can play around with different formatting and things.
  * [Institutions](institutions.md): A place where I can keep various notes and information related to my grad school/career searching.
